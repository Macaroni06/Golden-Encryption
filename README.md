# Golden-Encryption
Golden encryption is a novel ground-breaking revolutionary encryption algorithm with unrivalled execution speed and error-correction abilities. It is predicted that it will soon replace AES to becomce the security alogrithm reccomended by the USA government within the next few months. Please look at our article for mor information.

This repository contains the c++ code to our golden encryption application. We have included the relavent CMAKE file for users who use CMake.

There is also a folder containing the source code for the AES algorithim that we conducted our tests off off. This code is based of SHARAD VERMA's implementation that can be found at https://coderspacket.com/128-bit-aes-encryptor-and-decryptor-in-c#google_vignette. The code has been edited to work on systems using CMAKE, improved optimisation and now includes timing. Inside the folder, there is the CMakeLists.txt file that will have to be linked to main.cpp in order to run.
